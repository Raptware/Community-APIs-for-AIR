# Contributing A BlackBerry 10 ANE

When building an API for the BlackBerry 10 SDK for Adobe AIR, you will start by creating a sub-directory within this _**PlayBookOS**_ directory.  Pick a name that suits your extension and try not to use spaces in your directory name.  It just plain makes things easier.  

As a recipe for building your API you can use the [BPS extension](https://github.com/blackberry/Community-APIs-for-AIR/tree/master/BlackBerry10/SampleBPSANE) as a good example.  


A _**README.md**_ file also needs to be created at the root of your directory where you can place all the information about how to use and configure your API.  The _**BPS extension**_ is a good example of what type of information to include in your README.md file.  This README.md file uses Markdown wiki formatting.
